# Kanku Dai - 観空大

Having **65** movements, _Kanku Dai_ is the longest of the _Sentei_ kata, as well as one of the longest kata in the Shotokan syllabus. _Kanku_ - 観空 - translates as "Looking at the Sky" or "Viewing the Sky," referring to the kata's opening sequence. The word _Dai_ - 大 - (big) is used to describe the kata's larger movements as compared to the kata's smaller version, _Kanku Sho_ - 観空小. _Kanku_ is one of three Shotokan kata that have two versions, _Dai_ (big) and _Sho_ (small). Originally, the kata was called _Kushanku_, and it still is in other styles, particularly in Okinawa. _Kushanku_ was the name of a Chinese diplomat and kung fu expert who travelled to Okinawa in the 18th century. It is uncertain if this diplomat actually created the kata (or if he even existed), but many credit the kata to one of his alleged students, _Santunuku Sakugawa_.

_Kanku Dai_ is basically an amalgamation of the _Heian_ and _Tekki_ kata. When practicing this kata, one will find many pieces of H2-H5, and even some T1. This is because the _Heian_ katas were created for pedagogical purposes by _Itosu Anko_ from older katas such as _Kanku Dai_ to facilitate the teaching the art to young students. It is a very energetic kata involving jumping, dropping, and spinning techniques. It is said that this was _Funakoshi Gichin_'s favorite kata. Although the kata tends to favor the use of _shuto-uchi_, _Kanku Dai_ offers two unique combinations, _ura-zuki_ & _ude-tate-fuse_ and  _gedan-uke_/_furiage_. The very difficult jumping _nidan-geri_ is also first practiced in this kata. _Kanku Dai_ has many high and low techniques, requiring a certain amount of flexibility. It is a highly dynamic kata that must be performed with grace in motion.
