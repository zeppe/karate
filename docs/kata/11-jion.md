# Jion - 慈恩

_Jion_ is believed to be named after the _Jion-ji_, a Buddhist temple in China. Since there are many _Jion-ji_ temples in existence, it is uncertain which one the kata refers to. The actual translation of _Jion_ means "Love and Goodness." Although the kata's creator is unknown, credit is usually given to _Sokon Matsumura_, who is presumed to have learned this kata during his travels to China. _Jion_ is the simplest of the _Sentei_ kata and is comprised mostly of pieces from _Heian_ and _Tekki_ kata. It has **47** counts and contains some of the most basic movements that Shotokan has to offer. Being a simple kata, there are no fancy moves to hide behind. If a student possesses poor basics, then the performance of _Jion_ will be weak. For this reason, it is an excellent kata to judge one's overall technique. The idea when performing the kata is to be like a Buddha, with a strong yet humble spirit. The simplicity of its movements demonstrates one's humility, yet each technique should be performed with explosive power and unwavering stability. Instructors have been known to group _Jion_ along with _Jitte_ and _Jiin_ (the latter not in the official JKA syllabus), since each start with the same hand-over-fist salutation and have very similar movements.
