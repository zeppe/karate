# Gankaku - 岩鶴

Legend has it that _Gankaku_ was created by Sokon Matsumura, who was inspired by the teachings of a shipwrecked Chinese sailor skilled in the art of kung fu. Formerly known as _Chinto_ (Battle East), _Gankaku_ is one of the most graceful Shotokan kata. The kata is usually translated as "Crane on a Rock," referring to the crane stance (_tsuru-ashi-dachi_), when one must sink on one-leg as if a crane perched, ready to strike. The crane stance in _Gankaku_ is performed in _manji-kamae_ and is always followed by an uraken/yoko-keage (followed by a punch) combo. Even though the kata has many fast and sharp attacks, it also exhibits several slow postures as well, lending a certain calmness to the kata, especially given the slow double-counts in _tsuru-ashi-dachi_. The _embusen_ of this kata is a straight line (perpendicular to _Tekki_), characteristic of fighting in narrow passages or alleys (or even stairways).

_Gankaku_ has several challenging forward spinning turns, unlike most kata which have reverse turning motions. Simply put, forward turns begin with a stepping forward motion in order to change direction while reverse turns begin with a backward stepping motion to change direction. The only "normal" reverse stepping turn of _Gankaku_ occurs during the 3rd _manji-uke_ (\#17), and even that is performed linearly (360 degrees), making it more difficult to maintain one's balance. In addition to forward spinning and standing on one leg, the karateka must also be agile enough to execute a jumping double front kick. As can be seen, the practice of _Gankaku_ helps to develop (and requires) excellent balance. The ability to pivot smoothly on one foot is also essential. Other aspects of the kata are fairly simple, consisting mostly of 3 repeated techniques: _kosa-uke_, _kakiwake-uke_, and _manji-uke_. The kata has a total count of 42.
