# Nijushiho - 二十四歩

_Nijushiho_, or "24 Steps," is named after the number of foot movements, or "steps," present in the kata (this is not the same as the count of the moves). Originally called _Niseishi_ (二十四 - twenty-four) in Okinawan, it is one of three Shotokan kata that descended from _Aragaki Seisho_, the others being [_Sochin_](kata/20-sochin.md) and [_Unsu_](kata/21-unsu.md). The _Aragaki_ kata are arguably the most popular of the advanced Shotokan kata, possessing unusual and mystical techniques, allowing a natural flow from one move to another. This is especially true with _Nijushiho_, where at certain points in the kata, the timing becomes very rapid, almost seeming a little rushed, yet always followed by a slow move to temper the kata's pace and maintain the kata's fluidity. It is an excellent kata for developing timing and rhythm. The _sanchin-dachi_ (hour-glass stance, not very popular in Shotokan), the traditional _haito_ (palm down), and the _makiotoshi/teishi-awase-zuki_ combination (one of the "coolest" moves in kata) are all exclusive to _Nijushiho_ and _Unsu_, both of which are _Aragaki_ kata. The _hiji-ate_ at the beginning of the kata, the several _awase-zuki_, and the _haishu_ techniques are all solely found in _Nijushiho_, bringing to light a variety of new applications involving arm-locks, chokes, etc. The _embusen_ is fairly compact, not allowing for too many steps in any one direction, and changes in direction are made with very little motion, giving this kata a fairly small frame. The kata abounds with double-hand attacks and elbow strikes which are often used for close range fighting. All of this lends to the idea that the karateka must defend within a small space, quickly changing opponents. The only long-range techniques found in _Nijushiho_ are the two _yokogeri-kekomi_, the only _chudan-kekomi_ found in any kata (unlike the _gedan-kekomi_ from _Bassai Dai_). However, these kicks are considered a recent innovation, previously being only knee lifts, and were most likely not present in the kata's original form. _Nijushiho_ presently has a count of **34**, with the two kiai points at \#18 and \#33 (Best Karate \#10, 33 counts, kiai \#18 & \#32).
