# Jitte - 十手

_Jitte_ (or _Jutte_) means "Ten Hands". Mastery of the kata is supposed to imply that the karateka is able to perform the actions of ten men, further inferring that one has the ability to fight off ten armed opponents. Even within the Shotokan style, this kata has many variations. The JKA version consists of **24** moves. Jitte is a very robust and "heavy" kata, having many powerful techniques. Even the slow movements are executed with a certain vigour and tension. Although _Jitte_ does not have any really complex movements, some of the hip motions require a lot of practice to develop proper _kime_. It is essential that the karateka demonstrate true budo spirit in each attack and defence, and every movement should be completed with absolute confidence and destructive power.

Many of the applications for _Jitte_ focus on defences against stick (_bo_) attacks; _Jitte_ offers some new and unique techniques to that end such as _bo-tsukami-uke_, followed by _bo-toriage_, followed by _bo-oshimodoshi_. The _zenwan-uchi-barai_ is likewise only found in this _kata_. _Tekubi-osae-uke_/_tekubi-kake-uke_ occur in several other advanced _kata_, but are usually learned first in _Jitte_. The "stick defence" applications of _Jitte_ usually work equally well against an opponent's arm, providing many arm-breaking techniques.
