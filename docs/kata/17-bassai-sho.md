# Bassai Sho - バッサイ小

Another one of _Itosu Yasutsune_'s "second editions," _Bassai Sho_ is the smaller version of "Penetrating a Fortress", having fewer movements and a slightly smaller frame than its predecessor, [_Bassai Dai_](kata/09-bassai-dai.md). Since there exist many different versions of _Bassai_ kata, it is uncertain which one _Itosu_ used as a model for _Bassai Sho_. It is entirely possible that _Bassai Sho_ is simply one of the different versions of _Bassai_ and was imported by _Itosu_. In either case, _Bassai Sho_ is similar to _Bassai Dai_ in its _embusen_ and style of movement. While _Bassai Dai_ is a very heavy kata that uses very large movements to demonstrate outer strength and power, the smaller techniques of _Bassai Sho_ should exhibit an inner calm and energy.

Many of the kata's applications involve defenses against stick attacks. The kata uses many grasping (tiger-mouth) blocks to that effect. Although _Bassai Sho_ contains standard techniques found in other kata, they are performed is a very unusual manner. For example, using the back of the hand for _awase-uke_, or performing double _tsukami-uke_ vertically. New adaptations for previously learned techniques are prevalent in _Bassai Sho_. The kata has a total count of **27** and, although at one time the kiai points were on moves \#17 and \#25 (_Best Karate_ \#9), presently they are on moves \#17 and \#22.
