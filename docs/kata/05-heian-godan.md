# Heian Godan -　平安五段

_Heian Godan_ is the last kata in the _Heian_ series and has **23** counts. A combination of quick and slow movements, timing skill and fluidity of motion are essential for this kata. It is the first Shotokan kata containing a jump (_tobi-komi_), a very exciting technique for beginner and intermediate karateka. _Mikazuki-geri_ is also first seen in H5. The _mizu-nagare-no-kamae_ at the beginning of the kata and the _shuto-uchikomi_/_manji-uke_ combo at the end are extremely vital for proper kata performance. Bunkai for H5 involve many throws, locks, and takedowns.
