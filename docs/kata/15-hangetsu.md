# Hangetsu - 半月

It is said that _Sokon Matsumura_ learned this kata during one of his journeys to China. Like many Shotokan kata, _Hangetsu_ can be found in other styles of karate as well, and with several variations. The JKA version has **41** counts. This kata in particular is believed to be one of the oldest, and it is common particularly in the _Naha-te_ school. Other styles of karate tend to use the kata's original name of _Seisan_ - 十三 (or _Seishan_), which means "13". Some say the number 13 refers to the original number of steps of the kata, others believe it refers to the number of different techniques found in the kata. These theories have no historical ground. _Gichin Funakoshi_ changed the kata's name to _Hangetsu_, meaning "Half-Moon," describing the semi-circular movements of the hands and feet during the kata's beginning sequence. Although many kata have these same circular movements (i.e. step in _zenkutsu-dachi_), the half-moon sliding motions of the feet tend to be a little larger and more pronounced when performing _hangetsu_ stance. The half-moon shape is also seen at the end of the kata, with the leg and hand movements during the _uraken-uchi_, and of course, with the _mikazuki-geri_.

_Hangetsu_ is a very unique kata within the Shotokan system. It is an internal kata, focusing on the cultivation and release of _ki_ energy, or one's inner force. The kata's main stance, _hangetsu-dachi_, is an inner tension stance that only appears in this kata and nowhere else (hence the name of the stance). As such, it tends to be a very under-developed stance that is rarely _practised_. Most of the kata's slow moves are executed with atypical tension and isometric contraction. Emphasis is on strong breathing and muscular contraction of the legs, buttocks, and abdominals. Some instructors in other styles teach the slow moves with _ibuki_ breathing (hard, forceful breathing accompanied by throat contraction). However, this is not the norm for _Shotokan_ schools and is much more common in styles like _Goju-ryu_. Quite simply, _Hangetsu_ is meditation in motion, with the aim of developing one's _ki_. _Bunkai_ involve close range fighting in which the _hangetsu_ stance is used to move in between an opponent's legs (or around them) to break their balance.
