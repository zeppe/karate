# Enpi - 燕飛

_Enpi_ (formerly known as _Wanshū_ - 汪輯 - "Wang's series", named after a Chinese diplomat who taught martial arts in Okinawa in the 1600s) has **37** counts, making it the shortest of the _Sentei_ kata. _Enpi_ translates as "Flying Swallow" or "Flight of the Swallow." It is a very dynamic kata, requiring speed and agility. It gets its name from the diving patterns of the swallow, a small bird known for its excellent swiftness and speedy turns. Hence, the kata is characterized by quick changes in direction, as well as many sinking and rising motions that mimic the swallow's flight. Just as the swallow catches flying insects in mid-flight, the _bunkai_ of _Enpi_ focuses on catching the opponent in mid-attack, unbalancing him and making him unable to make further attacks.

_Enpi_ offers several new variations on previously learned techniques, usually by changing their angle. These techniques include _gedan-zuki_, _age-zuki_, _tekubi-uchi_ (similar to _soto-uke_), _teisho-oshiage-uke_ and _teisho-osae-uke_. _Enpi_ also allows for the practice of certain rare techniques that, although not unique, are not found in many other kata. These movements include dropping to one knee (_orishiki_), the reverse lean (in _hizakutsu_), and _kirikae-ashi_, an advanced form of footwork whereby the karateka switches the feet to counterattack. _Enpi_ is probably most noted for the spinning jump (_kaiten-tobi_) occurring at the end of the kata, making it attractive to younger karateka.
