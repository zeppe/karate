# Kanku Sho - 観空小

_Kanku Sho_ is a smaller and more advanced version of _Kanku Dai_. In Shotokan, there exist three kata that have two versions: _Kanku_, _Bassai_, and _Gojushiho_. Each has a _Sho_ - 小 (small) version and a _Dai_ - 大 (big) version, the _Dai_ form usually being the one with the larger frame and greater number of movements.  _Yasutsune Itosu_ is believed to have been responsible for these second editions. He used _Kanku_ as a model for the newer _Kanku Sho_, thereby creating two forms of the kata, each having similar _embusen_ and pattern of movements. When practising _Kanku Sho_, one can see that it does indeed have a smaller frame than _Kanku Dai_ and it also has fewer movements. At one time having a count of 47 (Best Karate \#9), the JKA has officially changed the count to **48**, still less than _Kanku Dai_'s 65. Although the shorter kata, _Kanku Sho_ is quite exhaustive, requiring a greater level of fitness, especially if it must be performed repeatedly. It is one of the more acrobatic kata found in Shotokan, complete with two jumping techniques, which are very difficult for the average karate student first learning them. The first jump is similar to the jump found in _Empi_ (_kaiten-tobi_), except the jump should be performed on the spot, rather than moving backwards. The second jump is a jumping spinning crescent kick. It is similar to the one found in _Unsu_ but easier, as the rotation ends in the direction of the kick, while in Unsu the rotation has 180 additional degrees. Like most things, these jumps get easier with practice, but then of course, become more difficult with age. As such, _Kanku Sho_ is usually the preferred kata of younger and more athletic black belts.

Although many of _Kanku Sho_'s techniques can be found in other kata, it is the only kata demonstrating _tsukami-uke_ with the other hand grasping one's own wrist (_kaeshi-dori_), providing an advanced wrist-locking application (_kote-kudaki_). As a final point regarding _Kanku Sho_, there has been some confusion over when to kiai. Kiai have been reported on moves \#6, \#28, \#29, and \#48 (\#47). According to present day JKA standards, the kiai are on moves \#6 and \#48.
