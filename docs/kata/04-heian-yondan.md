# Heian Yondan - 平安四段

The fourth _Heian_, with **27** counts, is the longest of _Heian_ katas, and has many similarities to H2. The kata's primary stance is _kokutsu-dachi_ (back stance), but students first learning this kata must also contend with the new _kosa-dachi_, a cross stance that is quite awkward for most karateka. H4 introduces the student to many new techniques such as _kosa-uke_, _shuto-uchi_, _kakiwake-uke_, _mae-empi_, and _hiza-tsuchi_. To perform H4 properly, a certain amount of flexibility is required as all of the _mae-geri_ (front kicks) are _jodan_ (upper level). _Heian Yondan_ also has more kicks (5) than the other Heian kata. Slow moves must also be mastered in this kata; there are four of them. Much of H4 involves double-hand techniques, with _morote-uke_ (double-hand block {x4}) occurring more than any other technique. Obviously, _morote-uke_ was held in high regard during this kata's creation.
