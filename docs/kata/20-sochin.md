# Sochin - 壯鎮

_Sochin_ is most commonly interpreted as "Strength and Calm" or "Energetic Calm." The translations of "Preserve the Peace," or even "Peacekeeper," are also sometimes used. Tha kanji 壯 (sou) means "big, strong", while 鎭 (chin) is "tranquility, peace" or "weight". _Sochin_ is a very bold and sturdy kata, marked by a commanding physical and spiritual strength. It is generally considered as a _Aragaki Seisho_ kata. Of the three _Aragaki_ kata practiced in Shotokan, _Sochin_ is by far the most grounded. This is due primarily to the fact that the kata relies heavily on the use of _fudo-dachi_, or "immovable stance," to such a degree that the stance became nicknamed _sochin-dachi_. Also known as "rooted stance," _fudo-dachi_ is probably the most stable of stances and is very tough on the thigh muscles.  As such, _Sochin_ is often practiced to train the legs. Although not the flashiest of kata, it is one of the most popular among Shotokan enthusiasts, especially at tournaments. The kata contains several slow, powerful techniques that must be executed with unwavering confidence and with proper muscle contraction and expansion. The student must project an imposing presence, instilling awe and trepidation in the enemy, allowing the karateka to utterly overwhelm the opponent with superior technique and an indomitable spirit.

The most notable technique in _Sochin_ (aside from the _fudo-dachi_) is the _muso-kamae_ (incomparable posture), _Sochin_'s trademark. One of the more graceful and intriguing kata techniques, _muso-kamae_ is a combination of rising block and down block, and when performed correctly, it is truly awesome. Other techniques of interest include _kizami-mae-geri_, _yoko-nukite_, _naiwan-hineri-uke_, and _jodan-mikazuki-geri_, all of which are exclusive to _Sochin_. Interestingly enough, _Funakoshi Gichin_ tried to change the kata's name from _Sochin_ to _Hakko_ (Eight Storms). However, this name never caught on and was eventually abandoned. The revised JKA version of _Sochin_ has **41** counts, with the kiai on #30 and #41 (Best Karate #10 40 counts, kiai on #28 and #40).
