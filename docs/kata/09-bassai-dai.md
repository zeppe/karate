# Bassai Dai - バッサイ大

_Bassai_ (pronounced _Patsai_ - 拔塞 - in Okinawan) is most often translated as "To Penetrate a Fortress," meaning that one must exhibit the power and spirit required to break through an enemy's castle. This is particularly evident in the kata's first movement, when the karateka launches forward with _soete-uchi-uke_. The word _Dai_ - 大 - means "big," describing the kata's larger movements, contrary to its counterpart _Bassai Sho_. _Bassai_, _Kanku_, and _Gojushiho_ are the three Shotokan kata that each have two versions, a _Sho_ - 小 - version (small) and a _Dai_ - 大 - version (big). Most translators agree that _Bassai_ can more accurately be translated as "To Extract From a Fortress." _Bassai Dai_ is believed to have been created by Sokon Matsumura. Much of the bunkai focuses on breaking the opponent's balance and defences against grabbing attacks. Like many Shotokan kata, _Bassai Dai_ is practised in many styles of karate, having several variations. The JKA version has **42** movements.

_Bassai Dai_ is usually the first _Sentei_ kata to be learned and is the most popular choice as _tokui_ kata by 1st kyu examinees for black belt. It is characterized by many switching arm-blocking combinations, making effective use of the _hanmi_/_gyaku-hanmi_ positions. Performance of _gyaku-hanmi_ in _Bassai Dai_ is substantially more difficult than in H2 because in _Bassai_, the front stance should not be shortened to accommodate _gyaku-hanmi_. Many  techniques are seen for the first time in this kata such as _tate-shuto-uke_, _sukui-uke_, and _hasami-uchi_. The _ryosho-tsukami-uke_ & _gedan-sokuto-kekomi_ combination is unique to _Bassai_ kata (both versions), while the powerful _yama-zuki_ can only be found in _Bassai Dai_ and _Wankan_. It is interesting to note that one of the most basic blocking techniques, _chudan-soto-uke_, is first used in this kata, and then never seen again.
