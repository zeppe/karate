# Heian Shodan - 平安初段

_Heian Shodan_ is the first kata in the _Heian_ series and is usually the first kata that a beginner must learn. It has **21** movements and its _embusen_ is roughly I-shaped. Essential points to learn in H1 include the _oi-zuki_ (lunge punch) and _gedan-barai_ (down block) which comprise over half of the kata. Also of great importance is developing the _zenkutsu-dachi_ (front stance), the main stance of H1. The student must try to master the arc-like moves of the feet and reversing direction, skills which appear time and time again in all kata. One must also develop power from the hips in both the _hanmi_ (for blocks) and _shomen_ (for punches) positions.
